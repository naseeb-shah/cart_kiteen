## Introduction

## Features

- Draw a random card from the deck each time the player clicks on it.
- Remove cat cards, defuse cards, and shuffle cards from the deck as per the game rules.
- Lose the game if an exploding kitten card is drawn.
- Win the game by successfully drawing all other cards from the deck.

2. **Exploding Kitten Card üí£**: The player loses the game if this card is drawn.
3. **Defuse Card üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è**: The card is removed from the deck, and it can be used to defuse one bomb that may come in subsequent cards.
